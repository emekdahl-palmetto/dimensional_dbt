## Why?
The flux capacitor is what makes time travel possible, but it needs fuel.
This PR moves us to use garbage fusion.

## What Changes?
- Moved Mr. Fusion to the back so we don't have to bring garbage into the DeLorean.
- The LED light triangle thingy pulls power from Mr. Fusion.

## How Does This Impact Me/Us?
- We no longer need radioactive materials to time travel.
